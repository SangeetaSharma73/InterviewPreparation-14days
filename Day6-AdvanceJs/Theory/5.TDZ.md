# Day 6 – Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript

## 🧠 What is the Temporal Dead Zone?

The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is a behavior in JavaScript where variables declared with `let` and `const` cannot be accessed **before they are declared** in the code.

- The TDZ starts at the beginning of the block where the variable is defined.
- It ends when the variable is actually **declared and initialized**.
- Accessing the variable during the TDZ results in a **ReferenceError**.

This ensures variables are **not used before being explicitly declared**, helping avoid unpredictable bugs.

## 💥 Example Leading to a ReferenceError

```js
console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a = 10;
```

In the example above:

JavaScript knows a is declared later with let, but since it is accessed before its declaration, it throws a ReferenceError.

✅ Comparison with var

```js
console.log(b); // ✅ undefined (no ReferenceError)
var b = 10;
```

var is hoisted and initialized to undefined, so no error is thrown.

However, this can lead to bugs, which is why let and const are preferred.

## 🧪 Example in a Block Scope🧪 Example in a Block Scope

```js
{
  console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError
  let x = 5;
}
```

The variable x is in the TDZ from the beginning of the block until the let x = 5; line.

📌 Summary

```txt
Keyword	          Hoisted	TDZ Applies	   Can Access Before Declaration
var	                Yes	    No	           Yes (but undefined)
let             	Yes	    Yes	            No (ReferenceError)
const	             Yes	Yes	            No (ReferenceError)
```

The Temporal Dead Zone is an important concept for writing safe, predictable JavaScript using let and const.
