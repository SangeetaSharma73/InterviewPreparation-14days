# Day 6 - Closures in JavaScript

## üß† What is a Closure?

A **closure** is created when a function **remembers** its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.

In simple terms, **a closure gives you access to an outer function's variables from an inner function**.

---

## üîÅ How Closures Work

JavaScript functions form closures by retaining access to variables from their **parent scope** even after the parent function has finished executing.

### üß™ Example:
```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;

  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

- The `inner` function **closes over** the `count` variable from the `outer` function.
- Even though `outer()` has returned, `count` persists because of the closure.

## üîê Closures for Data Privacy

Closures are used to create **private variables** in JavaScript ‚Äî variables that cannot be accessed from outside the function.

### üîê Example:
```js
function secretHolder() {
  let secret = "Hidden!";

  return {
    getSecret: () => secret,
    setSecret: (newSecret) => { secret = newSecret; }
  };
}

const mySecret = secretHolder();
console.log(mySecret.getSecret()); // Hidden!
mySecret.setSecret("New Secret");
console.log(mySecret.getSecret()); // New Secret
```

> `secret` is **not accessible directly** from `mySecret`, but can be manipulated through the provided methods.

---

## üîÑ Closures for State Retention

Closures help functions retain state over multiple invocations.

### üßÆ Counter Example:
```js
function createCounter() {
  let value = 0;

  return {
    increment: () => ++value,
    decrement: () => --value,
    getValue: () => value
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter.increment()); // 2
console.log(counter.getValue());  // 2
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

- Closures inside loops can cause unexpected behavior due to shared references.
- Use `let` inside loops or create IIFEs to isolate closures.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What it is          | A function with access to its lexical scope even after outer execution ends |
| Data Privacy        | Encapsulates private variables via closures                                  |
| State Retention     | Maintains internal state across function calls                              |
| Common Use Cases    | Counters, module patterns, event handlers                                   |

Closures are **one of JavaScript‚Äôs most powerful features** and are key to functional programming, callbacks, and asynchronous code.
