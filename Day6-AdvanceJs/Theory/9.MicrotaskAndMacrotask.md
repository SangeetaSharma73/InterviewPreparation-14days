In JavaScript, the event loop is the mechanism that handles the execution of multiple pieces of code over time, particularly asynchronous code. Understanding the difference between macrotasks and microtasks is essential to grasp how asynchronous operations are queued and executed.

🔁 Event Loop Basics
JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time. The event loop manages:

The call stack (where function calls are executed).

The callback queue (macrotasks).

The microtask queue (for high-priority tasks like promises).

🔹 Microtasks
✅ Examples:
Promise.then()

Promise.catch()

Promise.finally()

MutationObserver

queueMicrotask()

🔄 Execution:
Microtasks run immediately after the current synchronous code finishes and before any macrotasks.

All queued microtasks are executed before the event loop moves on to the next macrotask.

🔸 Macrotasks
✅ Examples:
setTimeout()

setInterval()

setImmediate() (Node.js)

I/O events

UI rendering

requestAnimationFrame() (browser)

🔄 Execution:
Macrotasks are scheduled in the callback queue.

The event loop picks the next macrotask from the queue only after the call stack is clear and all microtasks have been executed.

🧪 Execution Order Example

console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
console.log("Macrotask - setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
console.log("Microtask - Promise");
});

console.log("End");
🧾 Output:
javascript

Start
End
Microtask - Promise
Macrotask - setTimeout
Why?

Synchronous code runs first (Start, End).

Then all microtasks (Promise.then()).

Then the macrotask (setTimeout).
