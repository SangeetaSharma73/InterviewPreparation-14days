# Day 6 - Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript

## üß† What is Prototypal Inheritance?

JavaScript uses **prototypal inheritance**, meaning objects can inherit directly from other objects using a **prototype chain**.

Every object in JavaScript has an internal link to another object called its **prototype**, from which it can inherit properties and methods.

## üîß Constructor Functions

Before ES6, constructor functions were the primary way to implement inheritance.

### üß™ Example:
```js
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(this.name + " makes a sound.");
};

const dog = new Animal("Dog");
dog.speak(); // Dog makes a sound.
```

- `Animal.prototype` holds shared methods.
- Instances like `dog` can access `speak` via the prototype chain.

---

## üèó Class Syntax (ES6)

ES6 introduced the `class` syntax, which is **syntactic sugar** over prototypal inheritance.

### üß™ Example:
```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(this.name + " makes a sound.");
  }
}

const cat = new Animal("Cat");
cat.speak(); // Cat makes a sound.
```

- Under the hood, class methods are still added to the prototype.

## üß¨ Inheritance Example

### Using Constructor Functions
```js
function Dog(name, breed) {
  Animal.call(this, name); // Call parent constructor
  this.breed = breed;
}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
```

### Using Class Syntax
```js
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Call parent constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  bark() {
    console.log(this.name + " barks.");
  }
}
```

## üîç Key Differences

| Feature               | Constructor Functions         | Class Syntax (ES6)              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Syntax Complexity     | Verbose & Manual              | Cleaner & Readable              |
| `super()` keyword     | ‚ùå Not used                   | ‚úÖ Used for parent constructor   |
| Prototype Setup       | Manual via `.prototype`       | Implicit via `extends`          |
| Support for static    | Not directly supported        | ‚úÖ `static` methods supported    |
| Hoisting              | ‚úÖ Hoisted                    | ‚ùå Not hoisted                   |

## ‚úÖ Summary

- JavaScript inheritance is **prototypal**, regardless of syntax.
- `class` syntax is preferred for readability and structure in modern code.
- Use `extends` and `super()` for clean inheritance with classes.
