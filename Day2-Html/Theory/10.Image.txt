ðŸ§© Topic: How to Add an Image in HTML (<img> Tag)
ðŸ”¹ D â€“ Definition
The <img> tag in HTML is used to embed an image in a webpage. It is a void element, meaning it does not need a closing tag. Instead, it uses attributes like src and alt to define the image source and description.

Basic Syntax:


<img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
ðŸ”¹ U â€“ Use Cases
ðŸ”¸ Displaying product or profile images

ðŸ”¸ Embedding logos or icons

ðŸ”¸ Adding visual content to articles or blogs

ðŸ”¸ Using background graphics or illustrations

ðŸ”¸ Responsive images using srcset and sizes

ðŸ”¹ B â€“ Benefits
âœ… Visually enhances user experience

âœ… Supports branding and UI clarity

âœ… Improves SEO and accessibility with alt text

âœ… Loads from local or external sources

âœ… Can be styled and resized via CSS

ðŸ”¹ X â€“ Extra Info / Tips
Always include the alt attribute â€” it's used by screen readers and shown if the image fails to load.

Common attributes:

src: Path to image file (can be relative or absolute)

alt: Textual description of the image

width, height: Control image size (can also use CSS)

Example with additional attributes:


<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" width="150" height="100">
Use loading="lazy" to improve performance on image-heavy pages.
