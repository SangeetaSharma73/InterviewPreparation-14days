## 📘 Q1: What is HTML and What is It Used For?

### 🔤 What is HTML?

- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
- It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
- HTML tells the browser what to display and how to organize the elements on a web page — such as text, images, links, buttons, forms, etc.

### 🧱 What is HTML Used For?

HTML is used to:

- Define headings, paragraphs, lists
- Embed images, videos, and audio
- Create links to other pages
- Structure forms for user input
- Arrange layout with divs, sections, and containers

### 🌐 Simple HTML Document Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

- <!DOCTYPE html>: Tells browser this is HTML5
- <html>: Root of the page
- <head>: Metadata (not shown on page)
- <body>: Visible content (text, images, etc.)

## Q2-What are HTML tags and elements? Give two examples.

## 📘 Q2: What Are HTML Tags and Elements?

### 🏷️ What Are HTML Tags?

HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML. They are used to mark up content so that the browser knows how to display it.
A tag usually has:

- An opening tag: <tagname>
- A closing tag: </tagname>
- Some tags (like <img>) are self-closing.

### 🧩 What Are HTML Elements?

An HTML element consists of:

- The opening tag
- The content
- The closing tag

In short:
📦 Element = Opening tag + Content + Closing tag

✅ Examples of Tags and Elements
🔹 Example 1: A Paragraph
html

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
Tag: <p> (opening), </p> (closing)

Element: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

🔹 Example 2: An Image
html

<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
Tag: <img> (self-closing)

Element: <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">

|   |                    |
|   Content              Closing tag
Opening tag
Entire line = Element

### 📚 Summary

Term Description
Tag Defines the type of content (e.g., <h1>)
Element Complete structure including tags + content
Self-closing tag Doesn’t wrap content (e.g., <img>)

## Q3-What is the purpose of the <head> and <body> tags?

### 📘 Q3: What is the Purpose of the <head> and <body> Tags?

- 🧠 <head> Tag – For Page Metadata
- The <head> tag contains information about the web page, not the content shown on the page itself.
  It typically includes:
- Title of the page (<title>)
- CSS stylesheets (<link>)
- JavaScript files (<script>)

Character encoding (<meta charset="UTF-8">)

SEO info (<meta name="description">)

🛠 This info helps the browser understand how to render the page.

✅ Example:

```html
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
</head>
```

🖥️ <body> Tag – For Visible Page Content
The <body> tag contains everything the user sees in the browser window.

It includes:

Headings (<h1>)

Paragraphs (<p>)

Images (<img>)

Links (<a>)

Forms (<form>), and more

🖼️ This is where you put your actual page content.

✅ Example:
html

<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is the homepage.</p>
  <img src="logo.png" alt="Logo">
</body>

Q5-What is the difference between <div> and <span>?

📘 Q5: What is the Difference Between <div> and <span>?
🧱 1. <div> – Block-Level Element
A <div> is a block-level container.
It takes up the full width of its parent by default.
Starts on a new line.
Often used to group larger sections of content for layout and styling.

✅ Example:
html

<div>
  <h2>Article Title</h2>
  <p>This is an article paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>
🧩 2. <span> – Inline Element
A <span> is an inline container.
It takes up only as much space as its content.
Stays on the same line.
Often used to style small pieces of text or content.

✅ Example:
html

<p>This is <span style="color:red;">important</span> text.</p>
📊 Comparison Table
Feature	<div>	<span>
Type	Block-level	Inline
Line Behavior	Starts on a new line	Stays in the current line
Use Case	Layout blocks or sections	Style inline text or elements
Default Width	100% of container	Only as wide as content

🎯 When to Use Each?
Use <div> when you want to group and arrange sections like headers, footers, cards, or containers.

Use <span> when you want to highlight or style text inline without breaking the flow of content.

🧪 Example Together:
html

<div class="alert-box">
  Warning: <span style="color: red;">Do not refresh</span> this page!
</div>

Q6-What is the use of heading tags like <h1> to <h6>?

📘 Q6: What is the Use of Heading Tags Like <h1> to <h6>?
🏷️ What Are Heading Tags?
HTML provides six levels of headings:

<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>

<h1> is the most important (largest)

<h6> is the least important (smallest)

They are used to define titles and subtitles on a web page.

🎯 Why Use Heading Tags?
Structure: Organize your content hierarchically.

Accessibility: Screen readers use headings to help users navigate.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines give more importance to <h1> and <h2> tags.

Styling: Headings come with default styles (bigger font, bold).

🧪 Example of All Heading Tags
html

<h1>Main Page Title</h1>
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<h3>Subsection Title</h3>
<h4>Smaller Section</h4>
<h5>Even Smaller</h5>
<h6>Tiny Heading</h6>
🖼️ This will render something like:

css

Main Page Title ← h1 (biggest)
Section Title ← h2
Subsection Title ← h3
Smaller Section ← h4
Even Smaller ← h5
Tiny Heading ← h6 (smallest)
🗂️ Best Practices
Tag Use Case

<h1>	Page title (only one per page ideally)
<h2>	Main sections
<h3>	Subsections within an <h2>
...	...
<h6>	Smallest detail-level headings

❌ Common Mistake
Don’t use headings just to make text big or bold.

Use CSS for styling.

Use headings to structure content meaningfully.

Q7-What is the purpose of the <a> tag? How do you create a link in HTML?

📘 Q7: What Is the Purpose of the <a> Tag? How Do You Create a Link in HTML?
🔗 What Is the <a> Tag?
The <a> tag in HTML is used to create hyperlinks.
It stands for "anchor".

With the <a> tag, you can link:
To other websites
To pages within your site
To files (PDFs, images, etc.)
To email addresses or phone numbers

✅ Basic Syntax
html

<a href="URL">Link Text</a>
href is an attribute that holds the destination URL
Link Text is the clickable part shown to users

🔗 Example 1: Link to an External Website
html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
🖱️ Clicking this takes the user to Google's website.

🔗 Example 2: Open Link in a New Tab
html
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Open Google in New Tab</a>
target="\_blank" opens the link in a new browser tab

🔗 Example 3: Link to an Email Address
html
<a href="mailto:info@example.com">Email Us</a>

🔗 Example 4: Link to a Section on the Same Page (Anchor)
html
<a href="#about">Go to About Section</a>

<!-- Target element -->
<h2 id="about">About Us</h2>

🛠 Best Practices
Practice Why?
Use descriptive link text Improves accessibility & SEO
Use target="\_blank" cautiously Can improve UX but has security risks
Use HTTPS in href For secure links
Avoid empty href="#" It scrolls to the top unnecessarily

Q8-What is the difference between ordered and unordered lists?

📘 Q8: What is the Difference Between Ordered and Unordered Lists?
📋 What Are Lists in HTML?
Lists are used to group related items together on a web page.
There are two main types:

1. Ordered List (<ol>)
   Represents a numbered list.
   Items are displayed with numbers or letters.

The order of items is important (e.g., steps, rankings).

✅ Example:
html

<ol>
  <li>First step</li>
  <li>Second step</li>
  <li>Third step</li>
</ol>
Rendered as:

First step

Second step

Third step

2. Unordered List (<ul>)
   Represents a bulleted list.

Items are displayed with bullets (dots) or other symbols.

The order of items is not important.

✅ Example:
html

<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
  <li>Oranges</li>
</ul>
Rendered as:

Apples

Bananas

Oranges

📊 Comparison Table
Feature Ordered List (<ol>) Unordered List (<ul>)
List Marker Numbers (1, 2, 3) or letters Bullets (dots, circles, squares)
Semantic Meaning Order or sequence matters Order does not matter
Use Case Instructions, steps, rankings Grouped items, options, features

🧪 Bonus: Nested Lists Example
html

<ol>
  <li>Prepare ingredients
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mix ingredients</li>
  <li>Bake the cake</li>
</ol>

Q9-How do you add an image in HTML? Which tag is used?

📘 Q9: How Do You Add an Image in HTML? Which Tag Is Used?
🖼️ Tag Used: <img>
The <img> tag is used to embed images into an HTML page.

It is a self-closing tag (does not have a closing tag).

Requires at least the src attribute to specify the image URL or path.

Should include an alt attribute to describe the image for accessibility.

🔑 Important Attributes
Attribute Description Example
src Specifies the image file path or URL src="images/pic.jpg"
alt Text description of the image (for screen readers and if image fails to load) alt="A beautiful sunrise"
width / height Optional attributes to set image size (in pixels or %) width="200" height="150"

✅ Example
html

<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" width="200" height="100">
This adds an image called logo.png with an alternative text "Company Logo" and size 200x100 pixels.

🛠️ Tips for Using Images
Always use alt for accessibility and SEO.

Use relative paths (images/pic.jpg) for local images, or absolute URLs (https://example.com/pic.jpg) for web images.

Optimize image size for faster page loading.

Use formats like JPEG, PNG, SVG, or WebP depending on the use case.

Q10-What is the purpose of the alt attribute in the <img> tag?

📘 Q10: What Is the Purpose of the alt Attribute in the <img> Tag?
🏷️ What Is the alt Attribute?
The alt attribute in the <img> tag provides alternative text for an image.

It describes the content or purpose of the image.

It is required for accessibility and improves SEO.

🎯 Why Is alt Important?
Accessibility

Screen readers read the alt text aloud to visually impaired users.

Helps users understand the image content when they cannot see it.

Fallback Content

If the image fails to load (broken link, slow connection), browsers display the alt text instead.

SEO Benefits

Search engines use alt text to understand the content of images, helping with page ranking.

✅ Example:
html

<img src="puppy.jpg" alt="A cute brown puppy playing in the grass">
If the image doesn’t load, users see "A cute brown puppy playing in the grass."

Screen readers read this description.

🛠️ Best Practices for Writing alt Text
Be concise but descriptive.
Don’t use phrases like "image of" or "picture of" (screen readers already announce it's an image).
If the image is purely decorative, use alt="" (empty alt) to tell screen readers to skip it.

❌ Example of Decorative Image:
html

<img src="border.png" alt="">
