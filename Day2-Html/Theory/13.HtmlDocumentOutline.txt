ðŸ§© Topic: HTML Document Outline Algorithm & Heading Structure
ðŸ”¹ D â€“ Definition
The HTML document outline algorithm determines how the content of a web page is logically structured using headings (<h1> to <h6>) and sectioning elements (like <section>, <article>, <nav>, etc.).

Each heading tag defines the start of a new content section or subsection, which creates a hierarchical tree (outline) that:

Organizes content for users

Helps browsers and screen readers interpret structure

Guides search engines in understanding topic importance

ðŸ”¹ U â€“ Use Cases
ðŸ”¸ Structuring content into logical sections (e.g., Introduction â†’ Services â†’ Contact)

ðŸ”¸ Making documents accessible to screen reader users via heading navigation

ðŸ”¸ Providing SEO clues to search engines about what each section is about

ðŸ”¸ Powering skip links and outline viewers in browsers/dev tools

Example:


<h1>Blog</h1>
  <h2>Latest Posts</h2>
    <h3>Post Title</h3>
  <h2>Categories</h2>
ðŸ”¹ B â€“ Benefits
âœ… Accessibility: Screen readers use headings to allow users to navigate quickly between sections.

âœ… SEO: Search engines prioritize <h1> and <h2> content when indexing and ranking pages.

âœ… Maintainability: Logical hierarchy helps developers and users understand document flow.

âœ… Best Practices: Encourages clean markup and separation of content by importance.

ðŸ”¹ X â€“ Extra Info / Tips
Use only one <h1> per page for the main title (HTML5 allows multiple in different sections, but one is best for SEO).

Do not skip levels (e.g., avoid jumping from <h1> to <h4>).

Combine headings with semantic sectioning elements like <section>, <article>, <nav>, and <aside> for stronger outlines.

HTML5 originally had a more complex outline algorithm, but most browsers donâ€™t implement it fully. So, follow manual visual hierarchy with heading levels for best results.
