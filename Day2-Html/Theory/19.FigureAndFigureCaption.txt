🧩 Topic: <figure> and <figcaption> in HTML
🔹 D – Definition
<figure>: A semantic container for self-contained content—commonly images, diagrams, illustrations, or code snippets.

<figcaption>: A child tag inside <figure> that provides a caption or description.

Together, they associate content with an explanation or label in a semantic and accessible way.

  <img src="mountain.jpg" alt="Snowy mountain at sunset">
  <figcaption>Mount Fuji at sunset, Japan.</figcaption>
</figure>
🔹 U – Use Cases
🖼️ Describing images in articles or documentation

📊 Adding context to charts, diagrams, or graphs

📜 Explaining code examples or formulas

✍️ Credit attribution for artwork or photography

🔹 B – Benefits
Feature	Benefit
✅ Semantic grouping	Clearly associates content with its caption
✅ Accessibility	Screen readers can interpret caption as part of the figure
✅ SEO-friendly	Improves content clarity for search engines
✅ Flexible placement	Caption can go before or after the main content

🔹 X – Extra Info / Tips
<figcaption> must be the first or last child of <figure>—avoid placing it in the middle.

It supports inline or block-level content inside the caption.

<figure> is optional when only one image is used, but it improves structure when captions are needed.

Can also wrap media other than images (e.g., <video>, <audio>, <pre> for code).

✅ Visual Example

<figure>
  <blockquote>
    “The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.”
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption>— Franklin D. Roosevelt</figcaption>
</figure>
✅ Screen readers and browsers now understand this is a quote + author, not just two random elements.
