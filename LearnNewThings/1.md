AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the field of computer science focused on creating machines or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include:

- **Understanding language** (like how you're reading this text now)
- **Recognizing images or patterns** (like detecting faces in photos)
- **Making decisions** (such as recommending a movie or diagnosing a disease)
- **Learning from data** (this is called machine learning)
- **Controlling robots** (like self-driving cars or factory arms)

## Types of AI

- **Narrow AI:** Designed for a specific task (e.g., Siri, spam filters, recommendation systems).
- **General AI:** A hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can (we don't have this yet).
- **Superintelligent AI:** A theoretical AI that surpasses human intelligence (also not real yet).

## Examples in Real Life

- Chatbots and voice assistants (like ChatGPT or Alexa)
- Email spam filters
- Image recognition in social media
- Fraud detection in banking
- Self-faces in photos)
