1. Compare ES Modules vs. CommonJS, and implications for bundling and performance

Implications for Bundling and Performance
ðŸ”§ Bundling:
ES Modules:

- Favorable for tree shaking, allowing tools like Webpack, Rollup, or Vite to eliminate unused code.

- Enables better code-splitting and lazy-loading.

## CommonJS:

- Not tree-shakeable due to dynamic require calls.

- Bundlers must include entire modules even if only part is used.

## âš¡ Performance:

1. ES Modules:

- Browser-native support leads to faster load times in modern web apps.
- Parallel module loading possible.

2. CommonJS:

- Better for synchronous server-side logic.
- Blocking nature makes it less ideal for front-end performance.

## âœ… Summary:

- Use ES Modules for front-end development and modern Node.js projects to benefit from better performance, modularity, and tooling support.
- Use CommonJS for legacy Node.js environments or when working with older libraries not yet compatible with ESM.
