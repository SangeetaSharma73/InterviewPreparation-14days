# How does ESLint operate? Rule severity levels, configurations, and plugin ecosystem.

5. üîç How Does ESLint Operate?
   ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript, TypeScript, and other ECMAScript-based languages. It‚Äôs highly customizable and plays a key role in maintaining code quality and consistency across teams and projects.

## üß† Core Operation

Parsing: ESLint parses your code into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) using a parser like espree (default) or @typescript-eslint/parser for TypeScript.

Rule Checking: It runs rules (either built-in or user-defined) against the AST nodes.

Reporting: It reports problems (and optionally fixes them) based on the rules‚Äô configurations.

Autofix: Many rules support an --fix option to automatically fix issues where possible.

üö¶ Rule Severity Levels
Each rule in ESLint can be set to one of three severity levels:

"rule-name": "off" // or 0 - disable the rule
"rule-name": "warn" // or 1 - show a warning
"rule-name": "error" // or 2 - treat as an error
Example:

{
"rules": {
"no-unused-vars": "warn",
"eqeqeq": "error",
"no-console": "off"
}
}
‚öôÔ∏è ESLint Configuration
ESLint is configured using a file in the project root, like .eslintrc.json, .eslintrc.js, or .eslintrc.yml.

Common Configuration Fields:
Field Purpose
env Specify environments (e.g., browser, node)
extends Use predefined configurations (e.g., eslint:recommended, airbnb)
rules Define or override specific rules
parser Set a custom parser (e.g., for TypeScript)
plugins Add custom rule sets from the community

Example:

{
"env": {
"browser": true,
"es2021": true
},
"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended"],
"parser": "@babel/eslint-parser",
"plugins": ["react", "prettier"],
"rules": {
"no-console": "warn",
"prettier/prettier": "error"
}
}
üîå Plugin Ecosystem
ESLint‚Äôs real strength lies in its plugin architecture. Plugins can provide:

New rules

Rule sets

Custom parsers

Popular ESLint Plugins:
Plugin Use Case
eslint-plugin-react React-specific linting
eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y Accessibility checks for JSX
@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin TypeScript support and rules
eslint-plugin-import Managing import/export consistency
eslint-plugin-prettier Runs Prettier as an ESLint rule

You install plugins via npm:

npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-react
Then include them in your config:

{
"plugins": ["react"]
}
üõ† ESLint in Practice
CLI: Run with eslint . or eslint src/ --fix

Editor Integration: Works with VS Code, WebStorm, etc.

CI/CD: Used in pipelines to block merges with code quality issues.

Pre-commit Hooks: Can run via lint-staged + husky to lint code before commits.

‚úÖ Summary
Feature Description
Severity Levels off, warn, error ‚Äì determines how issues are flagged
Config Options Flexible, extensible via .eslintrc files
Plugins Extend ESLint for React, TypeScript, etc.
Autofix Automatically fixes many rule violations (--fix)

Together, Prettier + ESLint provide a comprehensive, automated code quality pipeline with minimal manual effort.
