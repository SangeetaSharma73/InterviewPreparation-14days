2. Explain tree-shaking: how unused code is eliminated and what stops it.

- Tree-shaking is a process used by JavaScript bundlers (like Webpack, Rollup, or ESBuild) to eliminate unused code from the final bundle, making applications smaller and faster.

* How unused code is eliminated:

- Tree-shaking relies on ES6 module syntax (import/export), which allows static analysis of dependencies.
- The bundler analyzes which exports are actually used in the codebase.
- Unused exports (code that is imported nowhere) are excluded from the final bundle.

* What stops tree-shaking:

- Using CommonJS (require/module.exports) or dynamic imports, which are harder to statically analyze.
- Side effects in modules (e.g., code that runs on import, like modifying globals or logging).
- Incorrect configuration (e.g., not setting "sideEffects": false in package.json).
- Re-exporting everything from a module (export \* from ...), which can confuse static analysis.

* Summary:
  Tree-shaking works best with ES6 modules and pure, side-effect-free code.

  - Dynamic patterns, side effects, or legacy module systems can prevent it from removing unused code.

* Here’s a simple example to show how tree-shaking works:

Suppose you have a module with two functions:

```js
export function usedFunction() {
  console.log("This is used");
}

export function unusedFunction() {
  console.log("This is NOT used");
}
```

And you only import one function in your main file:

```js
import { usedFunction } from "./utils.js";

usedFunction();
```

- How to enable tree-shaking:

* Use ES6 modules (import/export).
* Configure your bundler (like Webpack or Rollup) for production mode.
* In package.json, add "sideEffects": false to help the bundler know your files are safe to shake:

```json
{
  "sideEffects": false
}
```

- Result:
  When you build your project, the bundler will remove unusedFunction from the final bundle, because it’s never imported or used.

- What stops it:
  If you use CommonJS (module.exports), or if unusedFunction has side effects (like modifying a global variable), the bundler may not remove it.
