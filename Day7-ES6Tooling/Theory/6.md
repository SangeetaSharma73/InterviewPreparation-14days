# ðŸ’… 6. Discuss Prettier

- Prettier is an opinionated code formatter for JavaScript and other languages (like TypeScript, ON, CSS, HTML, Markdown, etc.). Its primary goal is to enforce a consistent code style by parsing code and re-printing it with predefined rules, regardless of the original formatting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features of Prettier

Opinionated: Prettier comes with default formatting rules (e.g., max line length, quote style, spacing) and discourages customization to avoid endless debates about code style.

1. Automatic: It reformats code automaticallyâ€”no need to manually adjust indentation or style.

2. Language support: Works across many languages, including , TS, X, CSS, HTML, ON, YAML, Markdown, etc.

3. Editor integrations: Compatible with VS Code, WebStorm, Sublime, Atom, etc., and supports on-save formatting.

Tooling integrations: Works with build tools (Webpack, ESLint, etc.) and version control systems (e.g., pre-commit hooks via Husky + lint-staged).

ðŸ§  Opinionated Formatting
Prettier intentionally limits configuration options to eliminate style debates. For example:

Indents with 2 spaces by default.

Uses double or single quotes consistently.

Wraps lines at 80 characters by default.

Ensures consistent trailing commas and semicolons.

This means all developers on a team write code with the same style, which improves readability and minimizes diff noise in commits.

âœ… Integration with Linting
Prettier can work alongside linters like ESLint (JavaScript) or TSLint (TypeScript, deprecated). Here's how the integration works:

1. Divide responsibilities
   Prettier: Handles code formatting (indentation, spacing, semicolons, quotes).

ESLint: Handles code quality and correctness (unused variables, unreachable code, naming conventions).

2. Disable conflicting ESLint rules
   Some ESLint rules (e.g., indent, quotes, semi) conflict with Prettier.

Use eslint-config-prettier to turn off formatting rules in ESLint that Prettier will handle.

npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
Then in .eslintrc:

{
"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:prettier/recommended"]
} 3. Use together in CI or pre-commit
Run Prettier and ESLint together in CI/CD pipelines or with pre-commit hooks using tools like lint-staged and husky.

ðŸ“¦ Example Workflow
Developer writes code (in any style).

Prettier reformats the code automatically on save or commit.

ESLint checks the code for logic and style issues not related to formatting.

CI pipeline verifies formatting and lint rules before merge.
