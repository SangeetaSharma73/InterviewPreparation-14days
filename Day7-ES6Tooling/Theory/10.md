# Best practices for npm scripts: combining build, lint, and start tasks.

## ✅ Best Practices for npm Scripts

- Combining build, lint, and start tasks effectively

- npm scripts are a powerful way to orchestrate development, build, and quality-check workflows directly from your package.json. With a little planning, they can keep your project’s development and CI process consistent, clean, and easy to maintain.

## 🎯 Core Principles

- Single responsibility per script – each script should do one job well.
- Readable and composable – use && or npm run to chain tasks.
- Cross-platform support – avoid OS-specific commands unless handled via tools like cross-env or npm-run-all.

## 🔧 Typical Script Structure

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext .js,.ts,.tsx",
    "format": "prettier --check .",
    "test": "jest",
    "prepare": "husky install",

    // Combine multiple tasks
    "check": "npm run lint && npm run format && npm test",
    "prebuild": "npm run check",
    "prod": "npm run build && npm start"
  }
}
```

## 🧩 Combining Tasks Effectively

1. 🔁 Chain Commands with &&
   Run tasks in sequence:

```json
"check": "npm run lint && npm run test && npm run format"
```

Each task must pass for the next to run. Useful for CI pipelines.

2. 📦Use Pre/Post Hooks
   NPM supports lifecycle hooks like prebuild, poststart, etc.:

```json
"prebuild": "npm run check",
"build": "vite build"
```

This will run check automatically before build.

3. 🛠Cross-Platform Scripting
   Use tools like:

cross-env – for setting environment variables in a cross-platform way.

```bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env
```

```json
"build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack"
npm-run-all – to run multiple scripts in parallel or sequence.
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "npm-run-all --parallel watch:js watch:css serve"
}
```

🧪 Example: Full Project Setup

```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rimraf dist",
  "lint": "eslint 'src/**/*.{js,ts,tsx}'",
  "format": "prettier --check .",
  "test": "jest",
  "check": "npm run lint && npm run format && npm test",

  "build": "npm run clean && vite build",
  "prebuild": "npm run check",

  "dev": "vite",
  "start": "node dist/server.js",
  "prod": "npm run build && npm start"
}
```

## 🧠 Tips

- Use descriptive names (check, dev, prod, start) to clarify intent.

- Abstract repeated logic (like file globs) into separate scripts or shared configs.

- Use pre/post hooks to enforce task execution order without duplication.

- Document your script usage in README.md for new developers or contributors.
