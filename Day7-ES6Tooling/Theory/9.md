📦 Bundler Modes — Development vs. Production Configuration
Modern JavaScript bundlers like Webpack, Vite, Parcel, and Rollup support distinct modes to optimize your app differently for development and production environments.

These modes control:

Performance optimizations

Debugging tools

Code output and minification

⚙️ 1. What Are Bundler Modes?
Most bundlers let you specify the mode via CLI or config file:

Webpack Example:

# Development

webpack --mode development

# Production

webpack --mode production
Or in config:

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: "production", // or 'development'
  // ...rest of config
};
```

2. 🧪 Development Mode
   Optimized for speed and debugging:

Example (Webpack):

```js
devtool: "eval-source-map";
```

3. 🚀 Production Mode
   Optimized for performance and file size:

Example:

```js
optimization: {
  minimize: true,
  splitChunks: { chunks: 'all' }
}
```

4.  ⚙️How to Configure
    🔧 In Webpack

```js
module.exports = (env, argv) => ({
  mode: argv.mode === "production" ? "production" : "development",
  devtool: argv.mode === "production" ? false : "eval-source-map",
});
```

## 🌐 In Vite

Uses mode with vite.config.js and import.meta.env:

```bash
vite build --mode production
vite serve --mode development
```

🎯 In Package.json Scripts

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "webpack --mode development",
  "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
```

## ✅ Best Practice

- Always use development for local dev, to enable better DX (dev experience).

- Use production builds for deployment to ensure fast, optimized performance.

- Integrate with tools like dotenv to handle env-specific variables per mode.
