4. What are source maps? Types (inline vs. external) and debugging benefits.

1. üîç What is a Source Map?

- When code is transformed (e.g., minified or compiled), its structure changes significantly. Source maps help the browser understand how the transformed code corresponds to the original code by providing a mapping between the two.

- A source map file typically has a .map extension and contains metadata about file names, line numbers, column numbers, and symbol mappings.

## üìÇ Types of Source Maps

There are two main types:

1. External Source Maps

- The source map is saved in a separate .map file.
- The compiled file includes a comment pointing to the map, such as:

//# sourceMappingURL=script.js.map

- Pros:

  - Keeps the production bundle size smaller.
  - Can be excluded from production for security/performance.

- Cons:

  - Requires separate file management.
  - Slightly slower to load in dev tools due to an extra HTTP request.

2. Inline Source Maps
   - The source map is embedded directly in the compiled file as a Base64-encoded string.

//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,...

- Pros:

  - Easier for debugging during development.
  - No separate file needed.

- Cons:
  - Increases bundle size.
  - Not recommended for production use due to size and exposure of source code.

## üß† Benefits for Debugging

1. Original Source View:

- Allows you to view and step through original TypeScript, SCSS, or X code instead of compiled/minified JavaScript or CSS.

2. Better Stack Traces:

- Errors in the console show line numbers and filenames from the original source.

3. Breakpoint Accuracy:

- You can set breakpoints in the original files rather than the compiled code.

4. Improved Developer Experience:

- Helps identify bugs more easily and improves development productivity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Production

- While source maps are incredibly useful during development, exposing them in production can:

- Reveal your source code (including proprietary logic).

- Help attackers understand your application structure.

- Tip: If you include source maps in production, restrict access to trusted users or use tools to obfuscate or protect sensitive logic.
