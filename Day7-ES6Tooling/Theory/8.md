# Polyfills vs. browserslist: targeting specific environments effectively.

## 🧩 Polyfills vs. Browserslist — Targeting Specific Environments Effectively

In modern web development, ensuring your code works across different browsers and environments often requires both polyfills and a Browserslist configuration. Though they serve different purposes, they work together to ensure compatibility and optimization.

## ⚙️ What Is a Polyfill?

A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript) that implements a missing feature in browsers that don't support it natively.

## 🔍 Example

Suppose you use Array.prototype.includes() (ES2016). Older browsers like IE11 don’t support it, so you can use a polyfill:

```js
if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function (search, start) {
    // simplified polyfill logic
    return this.indexOf(search, start || 0) !== -1;
  };
}
```

Or install via core-js:

```bash
npm install core-js
```

Then import:

```js
import "core-js/features/array/includes";
```

## 📋 What Is Browserslist?

Browserslist is a configuration standard used to specify which browsers your project supports. It doesn’t polyfill anything itself but informs tools (like Babel, Autoprefixer, and PostCSS) what transformations are needed.

## 🔍 Example: package.json

```js

"browserslist": [
  "> 1%",
  "last 2 versions",
  "not dead",
  "not IE 11"
]
```

This tells tools:

- Which JS features to transpile (via Babel)

- Which CSS prefixes to add (via Autoprefixer)

- Which polyfills to inject (if using @babel/preset-env with useBuiltIns)

## 🔄 How They Work Together

Tool/Concept Role
Browserslist Defines your target environments (which browsers)
Babel Uses Browserslist to transpile unsupported syntax
Polyfills (e.g., core-js) Implements missing APIs (not just syntax)
Autoprefixer Adds/removes CSS prefixes based on Browserslist

Babel & Polyfills
With Babel and @babel/preset-env, you can automatically inject polyfills:

```bash
npm install @babel/preset-env core-js
```

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        useBuiltIns: "usage", // or 'entry'
        corejs: 3,
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

- 'usage': Injects polyfills on demand, based on your actual code and Browserslist.

- 'entry': Requires you to explicitly import 'core-js' in your entry file.

## 🔄 Summary: Polyfills vs. Browserslist

```txt
Feature	                      Polyfills	             Browserslist
Purpose	             Fill in missing features	Define which browsers to support
Implements code?	      ✅ Yes	               ❌ No (guides tools)
Used by	Core-js,    MDN polyfills, etc.	        Babel, Autoprefixer, PostCSS, ESLint
Works with Babel?	Yes, via @babel/preset-env Yes, used to determine transpilation/polyfills
Example	               Array.prototype.flat()	"> 0.5%, not dead"
```

✅ Best Practice

- Always define a Browserslist in your project to ensure consistent targeting.

- Use Babel + @babel/preset-env + core-js for automatic polyfill injection.

- Use Autoprefixer with Browserslist to handle CSS compatibility.
