3. Describe Babel’s architecture: plugins, presets, and transformation pipeline.

- Babel’s architecture is modular and consists of three main concepts: plugins, presets, and the transformation pipeline.

1. Plugins:

- Plugins are small, focused modules that transform specific JavaScript syntax (e.g., arrow functions, JSX).
- Each plugin operates on the code’s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), modifying or replacing nodes as needed.

2. Presets:

- Presets are collections of plugins bundled together for convenience.
- For example, @babel/preset-env includes plugins to support the latest JavaScript features based on your target environments.

3. Transformation Pipeline:

- Babel parses source code into an AST.
- The AST is passed through a sequence of plugins (and presets), each transforming the AST.
- After all transformations, Babel generates new JavaScript code from the modified AST.

* Summary:
  Babel uses plugins (individual transformations) and presets (groups of plugins) in a transformation pipeline to convert modern JavaScript into code compatible with older environments.
