# Q4 – CSS Positioning: Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, Sticky

## 🎯 What Is CSS Positioning?

CSS positioning allows you to control the **placement** of elements on a webpage using the `position` property.

---

## 🔠 Types of Positioning

### 1. `static` (default)

- **Default** position of all elements.
- Elements appear in normal flow.
- Top/left/right/bottom properties **don’t apply**.

```css
div {
  position: static;
}
```

✅ Use: For regular content that doesn’t need manual positioning.

### 2. `relative`

- Position relative to its normal position.
- Can use top, left, right, bottom.
- Still occupies original space in document flow.

```css
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
```

✅ Use: As a reference container for absolute children.

3. absolute
   Removed from normal flow.
   Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (relative, absolute, or fixed).
   If no ancestor is positioned, it uses the <html> element (viewport).

```css
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
```

✅ Use: Tooltips, dropdowns, modals — elements you want placed precisely.

4. fixed
   Removed from normal flow.
   Positioned relative to the viewport.
   Does not move on scroll.

```css
div {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```

✅ Use: Sticky navbars, back-to-top buttons, floating widgets.

5. sticky
   Mix of relative and fixed.
   Acts relative until scroll threshold is crossed, then becomes fixed.

```css
div {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
```

✅ Use: Sticky headers or table columns that remain in view during scrolling.

🔍 Visual Aid

Parent (relative)
└── Child (absolute) → positions based on parent
└── Header (sticky) → scrolls until top, then sticks
