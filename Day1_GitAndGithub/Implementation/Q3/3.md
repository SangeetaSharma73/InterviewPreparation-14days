3. Rebase your feature/footer branch onto the updated main branch and force-push the rebased branch to the remote repository.

1. ✅ Ensure you're on feature/footer

```bash
git checkout feature/footer
```

2. 🔁 Rebase onto the updated main

```bash
git fetch origin  # Make sure your local main is up to date
git rebase main
```

During the rebase, if there's a conflict, Git will pause and show a message like:

```txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
```

To resolve it:

- Open index.html
- Fix the conflict manually (just like in the previous merge step)
- After resolving:

```bash
git add index.html
git rebase --continue
```

Repeat if more conflicts arise.

3. 📤 Force-push the rebased branch
   After a successful rebase:

- ⚠️ Warning: This will overwrite the remote history of feature/footer. Only force-push if you're sure it's safe (e.g., you're the only one working on the branch, or collaborators are aware).

### ✅ Summary

```bash
git checkout feature/footer
git fetch origin
git rebase main
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin feature/footer --force
```
