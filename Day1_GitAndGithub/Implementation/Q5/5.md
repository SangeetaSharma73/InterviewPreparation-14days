5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub from your feature branch, add a review comment, request changes, and merge via the GitHub UI using the squash strategy.

- To open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub from your feature branch (e.g. feature/footer), add a review comment, request changes, and merge it using the squash strategy, follow this guide:

✅ Prerequisites
Ensure you've:

- Pushed both main and feature/footer branches to GitHub.
- Navigated to the repository on GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/my-website).

1. 🆕 Open a Pull Request

   1. Go to your repo on GitHub.
   2. GitHub will often show a banner like:

      ```txt
      Compare & pull request: feature/footer → main
      ```

      - If you see that, click “Compare & pull request”.
      - If not, go to the Pull Requests tab and click “New pull request

   3. Select:

   - base: main
   - compare: feature/footer

   4. Add a title and description for the PR.

   5. Click “Create pull request”.

2. 📝Add a Review Comment

   - Go to the “Files changed” tab in the PR.
   - Hover next to a line of code and click the blue plus (+) icon.
   - Type your comment (e.g., “Consider simplifying this tag.”).
   - Click “Start a review” or “Add single comment”.

3. ❗Request Changes

   - Click the “Review changes” button (top right).
   - Select “Request changes”.
   - Write a summary (e.g., “Please update the footer text.”).
   - Click “Submit review”.

4. ✅ Merge the Pull Request with Squash
   Once the requested changes are resolved:
   1. Approve the PR (if required).
   2. Click the green “Squash and merge” button.
   3. Edit the commit message if needed.
   4. Click “Confirm squash and merge”.
      This merges all the commits from the feature branch into one clean commit on main.

### ✅ Done!

Your changes are now in main as a single commit.

The feature/footer branch can be deleted (GitHub usually offers to delete it automatically after merging).
