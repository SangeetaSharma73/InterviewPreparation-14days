4. Push your local main branch to GitHub, configure origin, track the remote, and verify using git remote -v.

1. ✅ Create a new repository on GitHub
   Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository (e.g., my-website). Don’t initialize it with a README or .gitignore if you’ve already initialized your repo locally.

1. 🛰️ Add the remote origin
   Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL from GitHub. For example

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git
```

Or using SSH:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/my-website.git
```

3. 🚀Push your local main branch and set upstream tracking

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

The -u (or --set-upstream) tells Git to track the origin/main branch, so in the future you can just use git push or git pull without specifying the remote and branch

4. 🔍 Verify the remote with git remote -v

```bash
git remote -v
```

Output should look like:

```perl
origin  https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git (push)
```

✅ Done!
Your local main branch is now pushed to GitHub, configured to track origin/main, and the remote origin is verified.
