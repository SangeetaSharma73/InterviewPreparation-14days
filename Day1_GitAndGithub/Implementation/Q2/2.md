2. Create and switch between two branches (feature/header, feature/footer), make distinct changes in each, then merge one branch into main, resolving any conflicts.

**✅ Step-by-step Instructions**
We'll assume you're still inside your initialized Git repo (my-website) with index.html.

1. 🔀 Create and switch to feature/header branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/header
```

Modify index.html in this branch:

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add header section"
```

2. 🔁 Switch to main, then create and switch to feature/footer

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/footer
```

Modify index.html in this branch (e.g., a conflicting change):

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m"add footer tag "
```

3. 🔁 Switch back to main and merge one branch

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/header
```

✅ This will likely merge cleanly, as footer edits don't conflict with header changes.

4. ⚔️Merge the other branch (feature/footer), handle conflict

```bash
git merge feature/footer
```

5. 🧾 View merge history

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```
