# Question 5: Git Remotes – origin, upstream, and forks

## 🌐 What Are Git Remotes?

In Git, a **remote** is a reference to a **version of your repository hosted elsewhere**, usually on a server like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Remotes allow you to:

- **Push** your changes to a shared place.
- **Pull** updates from collaborators.

### 🔸 `origin`

- The **default name** Git gives to the **repository you cloned from**.
- It usually points to **your own GitHub repo**.
- Used for pushing/pulling your own changes.
