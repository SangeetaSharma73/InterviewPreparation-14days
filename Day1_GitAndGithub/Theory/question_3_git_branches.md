# Question 3: Git Branches & Team Collaboration

## üîπ What is a Branch?

A branch is a separate version of the codebase that allows isolated work.

## üß™ Real World Analogy

> Like a copy of a shared doc where each person writes a new section before merging it back.

## üë• Benefits of Feature Branches

| Benefit       | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Isolation     | Work on a feature independently            |
| Collaboration | Multiple people can work without conflict  |
| Code Review   | Use pull requests to review before merging |
| Safe Testing  | Experiment without touching production     |

## üß¨ Visual Branch Flow

```
main
  |
  |------------------------   ‚Üê feature/login-page
  |                           |                          ---- commits
  |                          ---- testing
  |<---- merge back ----------/
```
